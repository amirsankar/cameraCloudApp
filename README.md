# cameraCloudApp

Create an app that lets users post photos to ‘the cloud’ and lets users see any/all photos that have been posted. 
Users should be able to leave comments and like photos that have been posted. 
Imagine a simpler version of Instagram—but everyone is the same user (or there are no users—same thing, ultimately).
